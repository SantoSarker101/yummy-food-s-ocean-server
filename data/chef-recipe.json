	  "description": " The Meatball Shop has slowly but surely taken over New York City, having just opened its fifth location and still growing. Chernow, who runs the front of house operations, not only has a background in modeling (can't you tell?!), but is also changing the game in the restaurant industry. Along with his Le Bernardin-trained partner, Chef Daniel Holzman, Chernow seems to be unstoppable, as their Meatball empire expands across Manhattan and maybe soon to a neighborhood near you.I keep it real simple. I love cooking whole fish on the grill.",
